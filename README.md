## ActiveRecord Lite

ActiveRecord Lite is one of my favorite, if not my favorite, individually completed projects at AppAcademy.  I enjoyed coding it so much because it's the first time I was using metaprogramming techniques to automate the definition of methods and it was code with  tremendous power but not many lines (of SQL).  It also greatly deepened my understanding of Rails' "magic" of simplifying .  Currently it has the most basic features of ActiveRecord, such as:

- [ ] DB querying based on specified or default options with #where method
- [ ] Returns results as objects
- [ ] Establishes belongs_to and has_many associations
- [ ] Stores association options for chained querying
- [ ] Establishes has_one_through associations with source_name and through_name options

Currently working on:

- [ ] has_many_through associations
